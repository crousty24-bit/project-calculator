# project-calculator

final odin project





This project is about creating a calculator. It should :



* basic math operators : add, subtract, multiply, divide
* take only 2 Numbers, 1 operator THEN return the result =
* each new input will go for a new operator (it clears the last displayed result): only one operator at the time !
* operators and result displays digits on screen
* UI have buttons for each digits, operators, including (=) and a clear button
* beware of a numerous potentials bugs, etc.



**For now, I'll only focus on the first 4 steps : DONE✅**



* **create 4 functions** for each basic math operators : add, subtract, multiply, divide **✅**
* define whats a **calculator operation** : num (operators) num = result **✅**
* **create a function "operate"** that takes an operation and calls one of the 4 functions operators **✅**
* **create a basic HTML structure** that contains : **✅**

 	- div buttons for each digits, operators and =

 	- div clear button

 	- display calculator : Numbers, operation, results



--> structure and code is set and safe to continue further.



**Next, I'll focus on step 5 \& 6 : WORKING ON...**



* **make the buttons works** accordingly with JS, **each buttons displays when clicked** : num, operators and THEN the result **✅**
* **add eventListener** for our buttons when "**click**"

&nbsp;	- done for digits buttons **✅**

	- done for operators \& equal **✅**

* the num1, num2, operator are **stored Inside variables ✅**
* WHEN the **=** button is clicked : **triggers the func operate ✅**

&nbsp;	- func operate takes our stored variables as parameters, THEN run accordingly to operator (add, sub, etc.)**✅**

&nbsp;	- output the Result and THEN **update the display with that Result ✅**

* **Last to do BEFORE step 7 : add func to Clear button** : when "click" it resets everything
