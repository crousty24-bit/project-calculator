# project-calculator

final odin project





This project is about creating a calculator. It should :



* basic math operators : add, subtract, multiply, divide
* take only 2 Numbers, 1 operator THEN return the result =
* each new input will go for a new operator (it clears the last displayed result): only one operator at the time !
* operators and result displays digits on screen
* UI have buttons for each digits, operators, including (=) and a clear button
* beware of a numerous potentials bugs, etc.



**For now, I'll only focus on the first 4 steps :**



* **create 4 functions** for each basic math operators : add, subtract, multiply, divide **✅**
* define whats a **calculator operation** : num (operators) num = result **✅**
* **create a function "operate"** that takes an operation and calls one of the 4 functions operators **✅**
* **create a basic HTML structure** that contains : **✅**

&nbsp;	- div buttons for each digits, operators and =

&nbsp;	- div clear button

&nbsp;	- display calculator : Numbers, operation, results



--> structure and code is set and safe to continue further.
